        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Pour boiling water into the bottom and let it cool for 30 seconds. Stop pouring when the water reaches just below the safety valve.</li>
            <li>Fill the brewing basket to the top with coffee. Use 1,5 Tbsp of coffee (15g) for each cup (180 ml). Tap gently to even out the grounds.</li>
            <li>Screw on the top. Make sure the filter and rubber gasket are secure.</li>
            <li>Heat the moka pot on medium-low heat. When  water in the bottom compartment starts to boil, the coffee will drip into the upper section of the pot.</li>
            <li>Listen closely. You'll hear a soft bubbling sound when the coffee is ready.</li>
            <li>Remove from heat and serve. Enjoy!</li>
